//! Wire messages for the orchestrator↔worker WebSocket control plane.
//!
//! Plain serde types, sent as JSON text frames over the socket. The orchestrator
//! serves the socket on its web port (`/cluster`) and a worker dials in. This
//! replaces the old protobuf/gRPC contract; the semantics are identical — a
//! worker announces its slot count, then receives job pushes and returns results.
